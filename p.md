Okay, I've added a bunch of new models to the ./station-glbs folder.

Please import them, moving each into the ./glb folder as you import it, place them on a new row in the grid layout. Once we adjust the scale on these, they're going to pretty large, so give the row a pretty wide spacing.

These models are space stations, not ships, so they should have a thrust rating of 0.
