description: Add new ships.
agent: build

Okay, I've gotten ahold of some new ship models! I have placed them in the ./new-glbs folder. Please add them to the game. As you add each ship, move it to the ./glb folder.

Take educated guessed about the appropriate scale modifiers for these new ships: if a ship's name says it is a 'fighter', give it a scale modifier similar to the average scale modifier of other fighters, if a ship's name says it is a 'cruiser', give it a scale modifier similar to the average scale modifier of other cruiser, and so on. This probably won't scale the new ships perfectly, but it should give us a good starting point, we'll fine tune the scale of individual ships from there.
