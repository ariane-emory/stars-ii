agent: build

The following ship(s) are oriented incorrectly: $ARGUMENTS. 

It looks like its direction of thrust/movement is currently towards its right wingtip.

Their rotation needs to be adjusted to fix their orientation. Analyze this problem, diagnose its cause, and fix it. 

The solution MUST be precisely targeted to only alter the orientation of tha named ship(s), NOT 'classes' or groups of ships, you MUST NOT alter the rotation of any other ships.
