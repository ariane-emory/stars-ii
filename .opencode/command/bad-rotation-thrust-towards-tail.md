description: Fix bad rotation (thrusting towards tail)
agent: build
---

The following ship(s) are oriented incorrectly: $ARGUMENTS. 

It looks like its direction of thrust/movement is currently towards the ship's tail. So, it looks like it's always moving in reverse, it needs to be rotated 180 degrees on that axis.

Their rotation needs to be adjusted to fix their orientation. Analyze this problem, diagnose its cause, and fix it. 

The solution MUST be precisely targeted to only alter the orientation of tha named ship(s), NOT 'classes' or groups of ships, you MUST NOT alter the rotation of any other ships.
