description: Fix bad rotation (thrusting towards tail)
agent: build
---

The following ship(s) are oriented incorrectly: $ARGUMENTS. 

It looks like its direction of thrust/movement is currently towards the ship's tail. So, it looks like it'd moving in reverse, it needs to be rotated 180 degrees on that axis.

Their rotation needs to be adjusted to fix their orientation. Analyze this problem, diagnose its cause, and fix it. 

The solution MUST ony alter the orientation of tha named ship(s), you MUST NOT alter the rotation of any other ships.
