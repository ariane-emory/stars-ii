The ship's nose is pointed straight down, and thrust/movement is towards what should be the roof of the ship's cockpit. 

Their rotation needs to be adjusted to fix their orientation. Analyze this problem, diagnose its cause, and fix it. 

The solution MUST ony alter the orientation of tha named ship(s), you MUST NOT alter the rotation of any other ships.
